Some programs I have made using C++

Button demonstration:
Create the window.
Respond to button presses:
On click "one", displays the word "ONE" in large letters in the blank space on the window.
On click "two", displays the word "TWO" in large letters in the blank space on the window.
On click "quit", close the window then have the program exit.
